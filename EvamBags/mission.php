        <div id = "content1"><p>Ethical fashion takes into account the numerous workers that work behind the scenes to make the clothing industry possible. From the farmers that grow the fabrics to the garment workers stitching pieces together. Some brands say they do social good but in most cases this is only part of their marketing efforts.We consider ourselves as a next gen fashion brand. Even though we are a small company at the moment, we have big goals. In practice, this means we exchange quick, short term gains by conscious long term planning and decision making. Every item sold by our company is produced in ethical working conditions in Hungary.</p></div>   
        
        
        <div id = "content2"><p>Slow fashion describes an approach that takes myriad impacts into account â€“ from resources, supply chains and living wages to environmental impact, pollution and animal life.To shop slowly and consciously is to buy less, choose well and invest in quality items that will stand the test of time from brands that advocate for fair treatment of people, animals and the planet.Slow fashion makes reference to the intention of our shopping experiences, how we care for our clothes, how long we help them to last and how we dispose of or recycle them.</p></div>
